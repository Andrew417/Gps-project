it works with 3.3 to 5 volts 
the more you raise V the higher the sound 

it draws a lot of current <span style="color: #00ffff">the battery must supply it </span>

**how does it work** 
we are going to use it with a microprocessor so we will communicate with serial communication with (UART) 
the pins to be connected 
- vcc 
- ground 
- tx 
- rx 
- speaker + 
- speaker -

there is a place for an SD card in it and this will host the sound tracks we are going to use 
they should be put in the root directory (<span style="color: #faff00">we can put them in a specific folder but let us just make it simple</span>) 
the sound files should be in `.wav` format 
they should be named or labeled with numbers as ids like this -> `001` that would be the first file and so on 
these files will be in the root directory 

then how does the processor deals with this module is via UART as mentioned above 

this happens as follows: 
the MCU should send commands to the module 
these commands are in the form of 10 consecutive bytes each one represents something in the command 

here is the format of the 10 bytes 
there are 7 out of these 10 which don't change so we are not interested in them 
the other 3 are the following 
- cmd -> command 
	- what you want to do 
		- play track 
		- pause 
		- play next track 
		- change the volume 
- arg1 -> the first argument 
- arg2 -> the second argument 
these arguments are not always used so when the argument is not used then its value will be zero 

here are the important commands 

the command byte is the one with the third index meaning it is the fourth byte 
the two parameters are the ones with indexes 5, 6 

the other ones are constant numbers 
here are they 

*commands* 
there are many commands but we are not interested in all of them just the command to play some specific track which will be the 
cmd -> `0x03` 
argument one -> `0x00` we are not going to use it when the files are in the root directory 
argument two -> track number 
this selects which track to play 

that is the command to select the track the other thing we might need to do is to set the max volume -> this will be an initial command to set the volume at first and then play the track
